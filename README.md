# Toss notification ui with framer-motion

[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)에 관심이 생겨 진행한 간단 사이드프로젝트. <br/>
평소에 멋있다고 생각했던 toss의 알림 인터렉션을 구현해보자.


# Demo

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
